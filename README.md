## Problem Statement
Plant diseases significantly impact global agriculture, reducing crop yields and threatening food security, yet traditional detection methods are slow, labor-intensive, and prone to error. To address this, we developed a hybrid pipeline that integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with Vision Transformers (ViT) and ResNet architectures for accurate and robust plant disease detection. SAM was used to isolate disease-relevant regions in images, improving data quality and reducing noise, while ViT and ResNet were fine-tuned using both original and segmented datasets from the PlantVillage dataset. Our approach achieved a top-1 test accuracy of 99.95\% with ViT and 99.81\% with ResNet on the original dataset, and 99.55\% and 99.40\%, respectively, on SAM-segmented data. Robustness tests further demonstrated ViTâ€™s superior generalization under noisy conditions. These results underscore the potential of combining segmentation with advanced vision models to improve the accuracy and scalability of plant disease detection, providing a powerful tool for sustainable agricultural practices.
